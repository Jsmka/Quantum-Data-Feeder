### Qiskit Global Hackathon 2021
Using the Quantum Teleportation Protocol to transfer data with extreme precision.

### The Issue :
The transfer of data is limited in classical computing and information cannot be transferred with absolute privacy.

### Our Magic Solution :
Data transfer between source to destination is the evolution of disruptive innovation. We can transfer multimedia content like files, images, etc... between two quantum computers. We proposed using the Quantum Teleportation Protocol to transfer the data from source to destination by extending the limits. We are learning to use the Qiskit library to establish the transfer of data.

### How it works :
1. ##### Step-1 :
The Input data is converted into Binary Digits. 
If the Input is Text, then every character is converted into Binary.
And if input is Image, then by using Pixels of that image the data is converted into Binary.

2. ##### Step-2 :
The Binary digits are given as input to the Quantum Teleportation Circuit and teleported through Qubits.
We used totally 24 Qubits for File Teleportation and 27 Qubits for Image Teleportation.

3. ##### Step-3 :
The Teleported data is converted back into the respective format of Input data.
